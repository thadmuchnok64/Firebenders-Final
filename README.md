# Firebenders-Final
A repository which holds the final release of Gator Gathering
The reason why we made a new repository rather than using the old one, is that the old one had a problem
where when commiting changes and pushing them, it would delete a lot of our progress. We have suspect
this is because of an incorrectly made gitignore file.
